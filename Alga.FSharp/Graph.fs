__Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.

This module defines the core data type 'Graph' and associated algorithms.
For graphs that are known to be /non-empty/ at compile time, see
"Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty". 'Graph' is an instance of type classes defined in
modules "Algebra.Graph.Class" and "Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class", which
can be used for polymorphic graph construction and manipulation.

The 'Graph' data type is a deep embedding of the core graph construction
primitives 'empty', 'vertex', 'overlay' and 'connect'. We define a 'Num'
instance as a convenient notation for working with graphs:

    > 0           == Vertex 0
    > 1 + 2       == Overlay (Vertex 1) (Vertex 2)
    > 1 * 2       == Connect (Vertex 1) (Vertex 2)
    > 1 + 2 * 3   == Overlay (Vertex 1) (Connect (Vertex 2) (Vertex 3))
    > 1 * (2 + 3) == Connect (Vertex 1) (Overlay (Vertex 2) (Vertex 3))

The 'Eq' instance is currently implemented using the 'AM.AdjacencyMap' as the
/canonical graph representation/ and satisfies all axioms of algebraic graphs:

    * 'overlay' is commutative and associative:

        >       x + y == y + x
        > x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    * 'connect' is associative and has 'empty' as the identity:

        >   x * empty == x
        >   empty * x == x
        > x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z

    * 'connect' distributes over 'overlay':

        > x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
        > (x + y) * z == x * z + y * z

    * 'connect' can be decomposed:

        > x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z

The following useful theorems can be proved from the above set of axioms.

    * 'overlay' has 'empty' as the identity and is idempotent:

        >   x + empty == x
        >   empty + x == x
        >       x + x == x

    * Absorption and saturation of 'connect':

        > x * y + x + y == x * y
        >     x * x * x == x * x

When specifying the time and memory complexity of graph algorithms, /n/ will
denote the number of vertices in the graph, /m/ will denote the number of
edges in the graph, and /s/ will denote the /size/ of the corresponding
'Graph' expression. For example, if @g@ is a 'Graph' then /n/, /m/ and /s/ can
be computed as follows:

@n == 'vertexCount' g
m == 'edgeCount' g
s == 'size' g@

Note that 'size' is slightly different from the 'length' method of the
'Foldable' type class, as the latter does not count 'empty' leaves of the
expression:

@'length' 'empty'           == 0
'size'   'empty'           == 1
'length' ('vertex' x)      == 1
'size'   ('vertex' x)      == 1
'length' ('empty' + 'empty') == 0
'size'   ('empty' + 'empty') == 2@

The 'size' of any graph is positive, and the difference @('size' g - 'length' g)@
corresponds to the number of occurrences of 'empty' in an expression @g@.

Converting a 'Graph' to the corresponding 'AM.AdjacencyMap' takes /O(s + m * log(m))/
time and /O(s + m)/ memory. This is also the complexity of the graph equality test,
because it is currently implemented by converting graph expressions to canonical
representations based on adjacency maps.
